# runr
[![build](https://github.com/paasim/runr/workflows/build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/paasim/runr/actions)

Tool for running scripts defined in yaml files. This can be used as a [post-receive hook](https://git-scm.com/docs/githooks#post-receive) on git remotes to achieve CI-type of behavior.

## Installation

Recommended way is to install the `deb`-package from [release builds](https://github.com/paasim/runr/releases). This includes [`podman`](https://podman.io/), which is used to run the tasks inside a container. Other options could be supported, but are not for now.

Building with `cargo` also works, but then `podman` has to be installed manually.

## Usage

For `git push` to trigger the runs, three things are needed:
1. `runr` installed on the git remote (and available on path)
2. `runr.yaml`-file on the repository root
3. A post-receive hook on the remote

### `runr.yaml`-file

`runr.yaml` should be placed on the repository root and look as follows:

```yaml
# optionally specify maximum number of parallel tasks, defaults to 1
# 0 means the number of cores on the machine
n_parallel: 2
# optionally specify default image for the task, defaults to debian:bookworm
# the images must have /bin/bash to run the commands
image: "docker.io/library/debian:bookworm-slim"
tasks:
- commands: |
    echo starting step 1a
    sleep 1
    echo ending step 1a
  name: "step-1a" # name of the task
  image: "docker.io/library/debian:bookworm" # optionally override image per task
- commands: |
    echo starting step 2
    sleep 3
    echo ending step 2
  name: "step-2"
- commands: |
    echo starting step 1b
    sleep 1
    echo ending step 1b
  name: "step-1b"
  depends: ["step-1a"] # specify dependencies for the step
```

### post-receive hook

The hook should be executable, placed at `hooks/post-receive` on the remote, and look roughly as follows:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
while read -r OLD_OID NEW_OID BRANCH; do
  BRANCH=${BRANCH#refs/heads/} runr
done
```

### Example

The `Makefile` contains steps for testing the behavior locally. Note that this assumes that `runr` is already installed and available on the path.

```sh
$ make test-hook # add a local bare repo and push to it, triggering the hook
